This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is basic reactjs slot machine game program,here i have used map function to loop over the array,i have used different file named Sdata.jsx for input data(kind of API data).i have made use of components,props etc.Its a fun game program,here input datas are 3 emojis,if 3 emojis are same then it returns MATCHED,otherwise it returns NOT MATCHED.

We can add input data inside from the Sdata.jsx file,i have built this fun-game program in my free time to understands the basic features of react js.
